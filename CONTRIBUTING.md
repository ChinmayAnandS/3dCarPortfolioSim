   git push origin feature-or-fix-name
   # or if you used main branch:
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Open a PR (pull request)**: Go to the original repository and open a pull request from your fork's branch (e.g., `main` or your feature branch) to the original repository's `main` branch. Provide a clear description of what you have done and why.
